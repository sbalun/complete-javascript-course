- Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant.
- In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

Your tasks:
    1. Calculate the tip depending on the bill value.  Create a variable called 'tip' for this.
        - It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅
        - If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!

    2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value,the tip,and the final value (bill + tip).

        - Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25”

    Test data:
        - Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
    Hints:
        - To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
        - Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's>= 50 && <= 300
 */

const billValue = 300.00;
let tipAmount;
if(billValue >= 50 && billValue <= 300){
    tipAmount = .15;
} else if(billValue < 50 || billValue > 300.00) {
    tipAmount = .20;
}
let totalValue = billValue + (tipAmount * billValue);
console.log(`The bill was ${billValue}, the tip was ${tipAmount * billValue}, and the total value was ${totalValue}`)
